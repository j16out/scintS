photon simulations using cuda/root/opengl

Too compile simulation:

	make sure latest g++/gcc installed
	source your root of choice, im using v5.34.32
	run comp.sh
	done!

	macro.cpp is the highest level and is the user interface which uses standard root for visulaization,
	contains all changable parameters
	macro2.cpp shows what else can be done with functions

	edit comp.sh to change executable


Too compile opengl interface:

	cd visopengl/build

	open Make and CMakeCach.txt files and edit the home directory to match your own.

	then make: make -j(number of cores)

	then cd../visualizer1/

	then ./visualizer to run
